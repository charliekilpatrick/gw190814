Don't get good SN fits, seems relatively blue, I see Halpa and OIII5008 in emission at z=0.218, so redshift is solid (I think)

4 minutes exposure (...), I see a strong line (both in 2D and extracted spec), if Halpha, this is z=0.164 (wildly different from gcn, z=0.275)

broad feature at 7000 Angstrom, narrow Halpha, Hbeta and OIII5008 for z=0.071, will go with some kind of Type II, phase unclear (no clear black-body slope)
